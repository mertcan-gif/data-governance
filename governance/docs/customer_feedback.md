Data Governance Feedback & Requests
This document is a shared space for us to collaborate on data quality rules and definitions. Please add your comments, questions, and requests in the sections below.

üó£Ô∏è New Rule Requests
Please describe any new data quality rules you'd like to see implemented.

Request 1: Can we add a check to ensure that the salary for employees in the "Engineering" department is always above $60,000?

Request 2: We should validate that start_date is always a valid date format and not in the future.

‚ùì Questions about Data
Ask any questions you have about the data, its meaning, or its usage.

Question 1: What is the exact definition of the salary column? Does it include bonuses?

Question 2: Who is responsible for updating an employee's department when they move teams?

‚ùó Reported Issues
If you notice any specific data that seems incorrect, please report it here.

Issue 1: I believe the record for Jane Smith (employee_id 102) might have an outdated salary. Can we verify this?
